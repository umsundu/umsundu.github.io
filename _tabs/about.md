# Welcome to Bad Packets - We Hunt Admins

This is not just another cybersecurity blog. **Bad Packets** is where **red teamers, penetration testers, and adversary emulators** sharpen their craft.  

## What We Cover & Plan to Cover
- 🛠 **Exploitation & Post-Exploitation** – Real-world attack techniques  
- 🔥 **Active Directory Attacks** – Escalating from user to domain admin  
- 🏴‍☠️ **Payload Development & Evasion** – Slipping past modern defenses  
- ⚙️ **Building Tools** – Creating scripts, malware, and automation  

## Why?  
Because **privilege is meant to be escalated.**  
Because **detection is just a challenge.**  
Because **we hunt admins.**  

_If just one person learns something valuable from this blog, it will have served its purpose._
